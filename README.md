# `mattrayner` QMK Keymaps
A set of keymaps for my various keyboards: 

* [PlanckEZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck)
* [ErgodoxEZ Shine](https://ergodox-ez.com)
* [ErgodoxEZ Glow](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/ergodox-ez-glow)
* [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/)

## Compatibility and additional software used
MacOS is my daily driver so some of the key combinations may not work on other systems. Primarily the various macros and shortcuts I have also added to control software which may be MacOs specific:

* [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) - window manager
* [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi) (brightness and contrast adjustment for non-apple monitors)
* [LastPass Mac App](https://www.lastpass.com) (password manager)
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) ([productivity app](https://github.com/mattrayner/alfred-workflows), and drop-in replacement for spotlight search)
